# Lync/Skype System Tray App
A windows .net application which automatically sends serial commands to the LED status light when a users presence status (away/busy/available/DoNotDisturb) changes. The application uses the Skype For Business 2013 SDK and sends serial commands over a COM port to the Arduino device.
